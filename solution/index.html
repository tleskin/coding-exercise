          When I started out with the code challenge, I began by looking through
          the tests and examining the rest of the code. I noticed the
          repo already contained models for coffees and customers, so I thought the best way
          to proceed was to create a subscription model and have a method to add a subscription. <br><br>
          This app reminded me of Sales Engine, which we completed at the end of
          Module 1 at Turing. Going off what I remembered from that project,
          I figured to be able to find all of the different
          things that were asked, I would need to have methods to easily call that info.
          I feel like it is sort of mimicking an app using Rails and Active Record. <br><br>
          Initially my coffee subscription didn't have a status, but as I worked
          through the tests, it was clear that the subscriptions
          would need a status. It began as an @active instance variable
          that was set to true. That would later be changed to false if the
          subscription was paused. I got through most of the challenge with this setup,
          but as I got towards the end, it was clear that the status for the subscription
          would need to become more robust and be able to account for three different
          statuses: 'active', 'paused' and 'cancelled'. <br><br>
          The reason why I created the method toggle subscription was that I knew
          I would need to be able to pause and unpause subscriptions. Rather than
          creating multple methods to do so, it seemed the easist way was to have a single
          method to change that status. This method along with the others for checking
          if the status was active or paused and canceling a subscription was put on the model
          since the subscription knew what its status was and should be able to change it itself.<br><br>
          Eventually I also got to the point where I was not only checking to see
          if a coffee was being subscribed to, but also if those subscriptions were
          active, so I had to create two different methods to be able to account for
          both checks. I think the place where I got a bit tripped up and had to
          add the method was for the spec "Bella Donovan should have zero active customers subscribed to it"
          and the next one "Bella Donovan has two subscriptions, one active, one cancelled". <br><br>
          One other design decision that I made was for an id to be passed in when creating
          a new subscription. Originally I wanted the Subscription model to be able
          to set the id automatically based on the last id that was set, but
          following some of Sandi Metz's rules, I knew that the Subscription class
          should only know about itself.
          To keep it simple, I decided that the id should just be passed in. <br><br>
          One thing that I thought was stange was that when you resubscribe, it creates
          a new subscription. Originally I was going to just use my toggle method to
          be able to toggle the cancelled subscription to active again, but I followed the spec
          and created a method to add a new subscription when resubscribing. This makes sense in case we ever
          wanted to see people who cancelled a subscription for a certain coffee. <br><br>
          The last design decision I made was to add a raise exception
          to the cancel subscription method in the DataStore. This seemed a simple
          way to alert the user if they were trying to cancel a paused subscription, but
          proceed with cancelling it if it was still active. <br><br>
          I realize I could have read through all the specs and tried to have everything setup
          initially the way it was supposed to, but I work iteratively. Code can always be changed.<br><br>
